    set_up allows for random selection of agents to be appending in the cells in the defined x by y grid

    outer for loop assigns row to an empty list

    outer loop look at the number of rows vs number of columns, hence the self.height in outer loop and self.width in the inner

    if row = [] happened to be in the inner loop, this would reset the cell at every iteration

    * for creative portion of this assignment, agent is defined with random_selection *

    __str__ prints the city grid as a string representation

    row_ele += adds the string to var row_ele and assigns it back to the original var

    this allows for begin_str (string overall output) to assign each row_ele var on a new line after cell passes through inner loop

    __str__ allows for object to inherit City class and ignore printing each row and column "manually"
